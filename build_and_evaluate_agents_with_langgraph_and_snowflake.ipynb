    "# Building a Multi-Agent Supervisor Workflow with LangGraph and Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **multi-agent supervisor architecture** using LangGraph and Snowflake Cortex Agents. The workflow consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervisor**: An AI coordinator that routes queries to specialized agents and synthesizes their responses\n",
    "- **Content Agent**: Handles customer feedback, sentiment analysis, and communication intelligence\n",
    "- **Data Analyst Agent**: Handles customer behavior, business metrics, and predictive analytics\n",
    "- **Research Agent**: Handles market intelligence, strategic analysis, and competitive insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → Supervisor (Route) → Specialized Agent → Supervisor (Synthesize) → END\n",
    "```\n",

    "The supervisor makes two passes:\n",
    "1. **Routing Pass**: Analyzes the query and routes to the appropriate agent\n",
    "2. **Synthesis Pass**: Combines agent output into an executive summary\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully built an **efficiency-optimized multi-agent supervisor workflow** using LangGraph and Snowflake Cortex. Here's what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components Built:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extended State Management**: Custom state with `messages`, `plan`, `agent_outputs`, and `execution_errors`\n",
    "2. **Supervisor Model**: `ChatSnowflake` for intelligent planning and synthesis (2 modes only)\n",
    "3. **Specialized Agents**: Three `SnowflakeCortexAgent` instances with direct chaining\n",
    "4. **Efficient Prompt Engineering**: Planning prompt emphasizing consolidated queries and clear tool separation\n",
    "5. **Optimized Node Functions**: Agents route directly to each other without supervisor re-entry\n",
    "6. **Graph Structure**: Linear execution with plan-based agent chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency-Optimized Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → Supervisor (Plan ONCE) → Agent1 → Agent2... → Supervisor (Synthesize ONCE) → Executive Summary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Improvements Implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue | Solution |\n",
    "|-------|----------|\n",
    "| **Repeated planning/re-planning** | Immutable plan - created once, locked with `planning_complete` flag |\n",
    "| **Cascading error chains** | Aggregated error handling - errors collected and deduplicated, not appended per-chunk |\n",
    "| **Supervisor bottleneck** | Direct agent chaining via `next_agent` field in plan steps |\n",
    "| **Redundant tool invocations** | Planning prompt emphasizes consolidated SQL queries (one aggregation vs multiple) |\n",
    "| **Duplicated invocations** | Supervisor only called twice (plan + synthesize), not between each agent |\n",
    "| **Overlapping tooling** | Clear tool separation - each agent has ONE tool with distinct data sources |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor creates a **single, immutable execution plan** that includes:\n",
    "- **`next_agent` Field**: Enables direct agent-to-agent routing\n",
    "- **`consolidated_query`**: Encourages single queries instead of multiple separate calls\n",
    "- **Clear Tool Boundaries**: CONTENT_AGENT (cortex_search), DATA_ANALYST_AGENT (cortex_analyst on metrics), RESEARCH_AGENT (cortex_analyst on analytics)\n",
    "- **`total_steps`**: Explicit step count for progress tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors collected in `state.execution_errors` array (not cascaded in output)\n",
    "- Unique errors deduplicated before storage\n",
    "- Graceful degradation - agents continue to next step even on partial errors\n",
    "- Summary synthesis includes error count without verbose per-chunk messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add more agents**: Extend the workflow with additional specialized agents\n",
    "- **Implement memory**: Add conversation persistence with LangGraph checkpointers\n",
    "- **Add human-in-the-loop**: Include plan approval steps for critical decisions\n",
    "- **Deploy to production**: Use LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio for deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [LangGraph Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)\n",
    "- [Snowflake Cortex Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex)\n",
